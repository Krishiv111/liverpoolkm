# What I learned
- I learned about concat adding two variables 
- Append wich adds new content into a list 
- Also I learned how to figure out the output by reading the list

# What I struggled on 
- I struggled on understanding the function of a concat and how you apply it througout code
- Also I still am a bit confused on how i can take stuff out of a list 

# Favorite Part of the Lesson 
- I enjoyed this lesson a lot as it applied a lot of vocabulary and principles for coding. My favorite part was the kahoot as it was an interactive way to get people engaged.
