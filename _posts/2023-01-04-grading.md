1 |0| Video met all criteria and the explanation provided contained all needed information|College board didn't give  a point becuase the explanation didnt contain the information and the purpose he just explained the function|
2| 1 | The written repsone showed two code lines and how code stores data and forms of triangles.| Collegeboard gave him a point because the code segments displayed were accurate and it stored correct data| 
3 | 0 | Explanation isn't concise and it does meet any of the requirement| College board also doesent give the point as the program doesent meet compleity|
4 |1 | Parameters were accurate and they worked in the sense of the code segment| College board gave the point due to the fact the program was developed accurate and purposeful|
5 |1 |Contains valid information so earn a point becuase its specific to algorithms being implemented|College board also gave him a one due to the fact his algorithm made sense.|
6 |1| The app was tested very well and it included all parts of testing for the app| College Board also gave this person a 1 as the testing works and the application is valid.|
