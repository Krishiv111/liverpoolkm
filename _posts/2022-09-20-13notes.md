# Program Design And Development


### Video 1.3.1
How is a program developed
- it is developed with an Idea
- Then the problem it was based on is investigated
- Also we have to talk about constraints 
- Observation w surveys
- Plan Out design and organize tasks
- Make prototypes and test

### Video 1.3.2

Acknowledging Code Segments
- It is important to acknowledge code actors 
- Program isnt solo
- Each member deserves to get credit for their work and contributions 
- Names must be written in documentation of the program
- When there is a problem the people who developed it can fix it 
- Even though they might not be apart of the project they deserve to be credited 

### Video 1.3.3


How developments are created 

-Programers use documentation and other things to describe the function of the program
- documentation is important because it makes you more efficient and it makes sense when you need to look back at what you did
- Comments are used with a # in python and a // in java
