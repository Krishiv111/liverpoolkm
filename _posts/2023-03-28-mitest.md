- Overall, I beleives I was able to preform decently on this mc test, due to the fact I was able to answer mode questions without the need of googling it. In order to get ready for teh AP test there are still some topics I need extra revision on. Firstly I need to understand how to implement a procedure within code,  this is beucase many time I read the proceudre wrong or I just simply dont understand this. This can be improved on by watching the video and taking notes in order to improve. In addition I feel when taking these mcq test I need better habits as sometimes I rush to answers and dont understand the problem fully. This can be fixed by oging through each option and fully understand the program.
