# Big Ideas

- I learned about making good habbits and making time for other hoppies. I will now make more time for going for walk, reading, and playing sports as those make me happy. Also I will connect with others. I learned a lot from the video, I think the speaker was great and the evidence she provided was very benificial. I will be able to use her lessons many times throughout my life.
