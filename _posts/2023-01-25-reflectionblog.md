### 5.1 Reflcetion 
> 1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing?
> Navigation Systems
- Allows people to find places with convienience and without paper maps 
- Incorrect Programing could help you get lost which would waste time and leave you for a problem to solve 
- In addition these navigational services can help you predict your eta and time it may take you to get form place to place. 

> 2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
- Yes I think those issues of dopamine are real due to the fact that people can get addicted to something like video games or social media  which prevent them from being active in todays society. 

### 5.2 Reflection
> 1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- In a digital world in order to be empowered it is all about knowledge, in order to get knowlege you should seek to educate yourself and make sure that everything you do is growing your mind and challenging you which will eventually empower you.
> 2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
- You could help somebody that nots empowered by giving them guidence and showing them that there is a way, at del norte we have many clubs and buddy systems which can help people guide one another to being empowered.
> 3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
- Yes a way that can block digital acknowlegement is the ability in digital rescources which can make other left behind leaving the world to create a divide. For example in third world countries where technology isn't the best and most people cant afford it most liokely they wont be educated restriciting empowerment. 

### 5.3 Reflection 
> 1. Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write.'
- Bias in a computer program comes when a program has acsess to the rest of your apps allowing them to show you things you may agree with.  However this creates a bias becuase it allows them to manipulate your feed in order for you to view things about a certain topic shaping your opinion and views. This is important because biased can be formed with programs rather than a rational thought out idea. I dont think this should be done by social media and other apps becuase they should just  be used for content and nothing else.

### 5.4 Reflection 
> 1. CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
- A crowdsource idea for APCSP would be a collaboritive chatting site on the class fastpages where we talk about the class and give tips for upcoming students and reflect on assignments. This will allow to give helpful information, and different perspectives. 
> 2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?
- An idea for crowdsourcing in del norte is to make a chatting service for all del norte students through a myplan discussion bard which allows to give information about different classes which can lead to new conversations and more club opportunites and connections throughout school. For my project is could be better with croud sourcing as we could use data to make charts and add reviews for diffent houses throughout our site 
> 3. What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week.
- For our project we could take data about the different houses on our websites which can give us more data to help improve layouts and allow for better user experience. In addition we can add a chatting forum where we talk about houses on our site and the persons experience.
