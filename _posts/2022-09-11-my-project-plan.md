# Purpose and Function

- I would make a game for soccer that will track players performance during games
- Also I would implement screen shots and my purpose throughout my app.

# Data Abstraction 
- I would collect data my making databases with implementing lists, keys and dictionaries
- Example: I would use a list to show the different teams and make a database with all the players of a team and their performance.

# Managing Complexity 
- I would manage complexity by making a section called wonders in my app
- This would be a way to show how I made my app and how others can do it 

# Procedural Abstraction
- I will do this by implemeting a blogging fastpage that will show my procuedure step by step and progress

# Algorithim Implementation
- I will do this by implementing iterations by making a search bar in which people can search for special things in the list

# Testing 
- I will implement this by showing how  I tested each part of my website with adding data from users
