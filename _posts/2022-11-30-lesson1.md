# What I learned 
- Something I learned about during the lesson is the function of a boolean which is used when asked true or false. 
- Also I learned the question what functions are put into a string such as intergers and ids 
- The vocab word that I learned is client that uses a data type 


# What I Struggled with 
- Although I was able to answer all of the question with ease I struggled with this problem 

**Consider the following code segment:**

- a ⟵ 10
- b ⟵ 20
- c ⟵ 30
- d ⟵ 40 
- x ⟵ 20
- b ⟵ x + b
- a ⟵ x + 1
- d ⟵ c / d + 2

DISPLAY(a)

DISPLAY(b)

DISPLAY(c)

DISPLAY(d)

**What is displayed as a result of executing the code segment?**

<mark>1. 21 40 30 50 </mark>

4. 21 30 40 50
