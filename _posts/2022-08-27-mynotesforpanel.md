## Summary 
The key takeaways from this event is that I learned compsci can be a challenge. Although that shouldnâ€™t be a reason to quit and make excuses. As you run into problems it is important you solve them using the resources available to you. In addition to that I have learned in compsci everyone has there own path but it important to be focusing on yourself and not to worry about others. Furthermore,it is important to have your own projects because if you want to continue your career you will be able to prove that you can understand parts of coding. Also compsci is in most aspects of life so if you can understand a language it will make it easier for you in the world. If you chose to continue in this field it is important to create a resume and connect with others in the field and continue to improve your understanding of code.
