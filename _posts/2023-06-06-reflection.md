# Skills I have Learned
-----------------------------------------------------------

- At the beginning of the school year I had entered as a person who was brand new with coding and using git, and vscode, through the year I learned a lot about algorithm, deployment, flask and fastpages. With all this new content approaching me I felt very overwhelmed feeling like this may not be something I am into. However with perseverance it allowed me to take a deeper dive with these skills and I came out a stronger person then I started with. Some of the crucial skills I learned within the course of this year was the knowledge of python algorithms, and data structures also my application of certain skills such as  collaboration, communication and presentational speaking skills have greatly improved through the constant meeting with scrum team, code reviews with Mr Yueng, and with the student taught lessons and allowed me to thrive not only in the class but also with other aspects of education in during application of leadership in clubs and in my other classes. Overall this class has taught me a lot and I am excited to improve and continue next year in CSA!

# Highs and Lows From This Years
-----------------------------------------------------------

- There were many ups and downs in the year but some of the lows that I have learned from was the understanding of full stack in tri 2 as I didn't understand the full picture and how it was implemented within a project in order to have a fully functioning backend, which led to a lot of personal confusion and suffering scores on the next project checks. However on the other side there were many highs like making new friends within my scrum team and the great memories in class with teh taylor swift songs, and attempting to hit the buzzer beaters.

# Future Plans 
-----------------------------------------------------------
- The future plans I have with compsci is to continue to work on my personal portfolio with gaining a better understanding with code in python, html,css with creating personal project over the summer to practice my coding abilities. In addiiton to that I will be taking CSA next year and over the summer I will try to get a head start with Java to ensure sucsess in the fall

# Plans With Career 
-----------------------------------------------------------
- With my coding knowlege I would like to expand on it by taking CSA, however looking past that I would like to go to college to get a degree in data science or computer engineering. With this I would like to work in a tech company as a PM or a software engineer and take all the skills I learned from this year to the next steps of my career. 

# Why I would Like to Continue With CS
-----------------------------------------------------------

- This class has helped me realized there are a lot of aspects with technology from emergence of new gadgets to fixing social problems like the digital divide. For this reason I got to love the idea that technology is so fast and with code you are able to solve many of the problems and emerge into the future. 

# Thank You 
----------------------------------------------------------
- I would Like to conclude this blog with a thanks to Mr Yueng for helping me with becoming not only a better programmer but a better person with all the lessons you have taught me and I have enjoyed being your student for the past 3 trimesters. Thanks!
