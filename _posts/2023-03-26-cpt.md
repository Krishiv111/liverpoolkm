# Plans to finish CPT
- In order to finish my cpt project I am looking toward adding more from previous lessons within class.Currently my CPT includes a GET and POST function from a database that is linked to my flask which incorporate sql and schemas and OOP programming. IN addition to that I have added a filter to images with an onclick function which shows that uses numPY grey scale function to show if a house within the DATA base is booked. However I would like to add more to it by cleaning up the frontend and the backend by making it look nicer and adding a cleaner perspective, also I would like to clean junk from the flask such as users.py and other things making it differentiate from other projects. With a backend perspective in order to finish my project I Would like add a OOP function that when something it clicked with booked it updates and changes leaving my project to be better.
