# App Overwiev 
My group and I will create an app that relates to fitness and health we will create bmi claculators and other clacultaors to help up. This will be important as it will show how we can use our coding knowledge to complete tasks in order to have a sucsessful app.


### Program Purpose and Function
The purpose of this program is to be able to teach people about fitness and overall show how we can educate people on fitness with the people of the app.

### Data Abstraction
The purpose of this is to have two seperate code segments which are not connected. One should show data being stored as a list and one should show data being used in the program function. 

### Managing Complexity
We will manage complexity by simplifyinh our code with the algorithims we use, the usage of dicts,lists,and conditionanals, and keys will be helpful. 

### Procedural Abstraction(

One parameter that affects the functionality of our procedure is our implementation of variables and inputs. These parameters allow us to take in information and use it to educate people on fitness. 

### Algorithm Implementation

We will use algorithms to calculate many statistics given inputs that the user provides. We will also use algorithms to create graphs and other ways to utilize the information calculated and provided for the users.

### Testing
The way we will make people test it is by making them use the several inputs and test our calculator, and even enter the fitness course to see who will be able to get a correct result.
