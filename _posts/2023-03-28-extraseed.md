# Summary 
- I learned a lot about csusm and I really learned a lot about hte reality of college and furthering education. Although it wont be easy it is important to network early and look for internships asap making a greater network opening windows down the line. In addition to that I really liked teh project we made as it allowed me to mix creativity with STEM we created a vibrating tooth brush with a help of a tooth brush a +/- cord and a battery that gave it energy. In addition I learned a lot from Ashley and John and would love to talk to them soon!
# Introduction

Speaker 1: John is a computer scientist at csusm he really enjoys programming and finds its a great interest 
within coding, he wanted to pursue computer science becuase he finds a great intrest with computers and he thought that he would want to look toward a better understanding. 

Speaker 2: Ashley went to csusm and is majored in applied physics, although she has failed many times in highschool and in college within calc and physics but she says this doesen't define her as a person and she tries to frequently, she often encounters compter scinece in her times when solving her problems. 


# Cal State SM Pathways 
- Wuthin csusm there are many options for getting a degree, you gan do with mathematics biochemistry, elecctrical engineering, and software engineering, bs biotechnology, and biological sciences. They also have specialty in physics, chemistry, biotech, math, computer science, software engineering. 
- Also there is robotics cybersecuriyy clubs, 3d printing, women in stem, society of women engineering, society of physics engineering etc 
- In addition you should have more ways to get involved and get into internships with to get more experience and have more conenectivity with other people,
- In adddition there are many summer programs called summer scholars program and it is a paid prgram allowing you to get paid up to 6000$ you can learn mmore about computer science and get a better undertanding of what you want to do
- When paying for college you are able to take loans whcih are subsidized loas nad unsubsidized loan and subsidizes one help you  with an unsubsidized loan, you have to pay back more money because of the interest that keeps adding up, while with a subsidized loan, someone else helps you out by paying some or all of the interest for you.
