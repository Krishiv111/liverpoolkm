    "Systems (OS's), pathlib is a solution to this problem. \n",
    "- What are commands you use in terminal to access files? To acsess files, in mac you have to use cd and ls to get into a directory.\n",
    "- What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? You use cat nano gedit etc. in order to acsess files.\n",
    "- What are some of the major differences? The major difference is that to get to paths its is easier and allows for faster and quicker acsess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide what you observed, struggled with, or leaned while playing with this code.\n",
    "- Why is path a big deal when working with images? It is a crucial part because if a path is not defined that means it will be hard to display an image and will take longer for oyu to implement this within a project or a program\n",
    "- How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? According to collegeboard unit 5 deals with data mutations and storage and the general understanding of data. meta data relates to unit 5 topics as it realates to understanding of different type of data.\n",
    "- Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? Ipython is interesting with juypter notebooks becuase ipython it helps display data from images without opening it from other sources exect jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? Base64 is a way to encode data into 64 characters, this is similar to binary to hexadecimal as they both use data within characters to data. However they differ as hexa decimial uses 16 characters while binary uses 2 and base64 uses 64 characters.\n",
    "- Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64.\n",
    "S3Jp = KRI; this is stored through the data preventing data from being lost within the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Lossless image \n",
    "![](socceriscool.jpeg)\n",
    "- This is an example of lossless data as when compressing the image you cant lose pixels very easy as it has it resulting in a lossless data.\n",
    "![](super.jpeg)\n",
    "- This is lossy as their is a mix of many colors which makes this image to being easily have lose more data showing that this is an example of lossy data. "
