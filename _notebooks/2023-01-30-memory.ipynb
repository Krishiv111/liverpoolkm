    "# Code Plan\n",
    "- The code plan is to first setup the frontend by 2/3 getting all buttons and user input sections displayed to fast pages. Then I will create the databases of each of the houses. After I will code the buttons in order to fetch the from the db using fetch in javascript, database with python, and frontend with sass and html. This will take me about 2.5 weeks but it will need a lot of planning to make sure that there is there is time to correct error and get perfection. "
