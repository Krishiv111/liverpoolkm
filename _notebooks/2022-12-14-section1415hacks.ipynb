    "# Summary of what I learned\n",
    "- In this lesson I learned a lot about libraries which are ways of code that are previously written so users can reuse them. Also I learned about different random functions such as radrange and rad int. Finally I learned about documentation and how it can level up your code through the through explanation it gives.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Vocab\n",
    "- Documentation: The what, how, or why of the code\n",
    "- Libraries: Prewritten code or procedures that can be used to maximize efficiency\n",
    "- API: Data stored in a database that can be accessed via code\n",
    "\n",
    "# Notes \n",
    "- Documentation is understanding the purpose of a procedure when it gets too long\n",
    "-random.choice picks a random item from a list\n",
    "- random.shuffle shuffles a the items in a list\n",
    "- radint: this allows you to generate a random integer from a set range\n",
    "- radrange:can be written like randrange(start, stop, step) where start is the minimum value, stop is the maximum value (like the randint function), and step is the incriment the values can be and its default value is 1 \n",

    "A. A random integer from a to be exclusive\n",
    "\n",

    "<mark>ANSWER: The advantage of using libraries is its a faster and more easier way to get code rather than having to write it and test it.</mark>\n"
