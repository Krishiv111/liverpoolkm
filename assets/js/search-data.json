Why not Google Drive or messages? | What&#39;s the difference between Git and GitHub? | Name as many Git commands as you can: | . Two Main Machines . Which is better, MacOS or Windows? | Give some differences between MacOS and Windows in terms of the development we use in APCSP: | If you are on Windows, you want to skip the MacOS Setup instructions. | . Our Tools: . What is the first tool you remember installing? | Why was installations so hard the first time? | Without looking back at previous notes, name three tools you remember installing. This can be kernels, extensions, any installation for APCSP, and also write why it is needed. | . Actual Installations: . Tool setup is a week 0 thing. You should already have the knowledge to set up your machine. There is also a high chance you had to remove your environments and set up your machine again due to errors. If, for some reason, these don&#39;t apply to you, go here to set up your machine, here to check everything working with Bash, and here for Docker setup, which are the main tools on our machine needed to develop in APCSP. . MacOS Conda Scripts . After installing Homebrew, VSCode, and Python2, you&#39;ll need to run these Homebrew commands: . brew list # list packages brew update # update package list brew upgrade # upgrade packages brew install git # install latest git brew install python # install python3 for development python --version # version of python3 installed brew install java # openjdk install . Windows Conda Scripts . To get set up, run these commands: . wsl --install wsl --list wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04 # restart machine wsl cd ~ mkdir vscode ls cd ~/vscode # changes the directory to path for vscode files git clone https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP.git # clone repo cd APCSP # changes the directory to path for APCSP repos assets code . # opens APCSP in VSCode cd .. # changes the directory to the previous/parent directory git config --global user.email mygmail@gmail.com # tell git your email git config --global user.name mygithub # tell git your github id shay@MSI:/mnt/c/Users/ShayM$ git config --global user.email your@email.here shay@MSI:/mnt/c/Users/ShayM$ git config --global user.name yourusernamehere # restart machine PS C: Users UserName&gt; wsl # Windows prompt to WSL command cd /tmp wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh chmod +x Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh # Answer yes to all the prompts ./Anaconda3-2022.05-Linux-x86_64.sh # run apt package commands now sudo apt list # list packages sudo apt update # update package list sudo apt upgrade # upgrade packages sudo apt install python2 # install python2 for package dependencies sudo apt install python3 python3-pip # install python3 and pip3 for development python --version # version of python3 should be shown sudo apt install default-jdk default-jre # java install java --version # java runtime version javac --version # java compiler version sudo apt install unzip # unzip utility . Setting Up Kernels . Now that you have everything installed on MacOS/Windows, we need to get kernels installed so that we can develop inside Fastpages notebooks. To do that, run these commands on both MacOS and Windows: . (base) id:~$ conda --version (base) id:~$ conda install jupyter # install jupyter (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list installed kernels Available kernels: python3 /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 (base) id:~$ # start in home directory (base) id:~$ pip install bash_kernel # download bash kernel Collecting bash_kernel Downloading bash_kernel-0.7.2-py2.py3-none-any.whl (15 kB) Requirement already satisfied: pexpect&gt;=4.0 in ./anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from bash_kernel) (4.8.0) Requirement already satisfied: ptyprocess&gt;=0.5 in ./anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages (from pexpect&gt;=4.0-&gt;bash_kernel) (0.7.0) Installing collected packages: bash-kernel Successfully installed bash-kernel-0.7.2 (base) id:~$ python -m bash_kernel.install # install kernel Installing IPython kernel spec (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list kernels Available kernels: bash /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/bash python3 /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 (base) id:~$ conda install nodejs # node is framework for JavaScript kernel (base) id:~$ npm -version # node package manager comes with nodejs (base) id:~$ npm install -g ijavascript # get the kernel (base) id:~$ ijsinstall # install javascript kernel (base) id:~$ jupyter kernelspec list # list kernels Available kernels: bash /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/bash javascript /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/javascript python3 /home/shay/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 . By now, you should already know how to clone Git repositories into your VSCode directory. Once you do that, you&#39;re all set for developing with GitHub Pages and Fastpages! . Before We Set Up Pages, A Guide to Git . As we&#39;ve discussed, Git is different from GitHub. Because GitHub is merely the place where we store Git repos, we use Git&#39;s commands to help us get, open, and configure these repositories. Here are some of the Git commands you should be using a lot (In the comments, tell what each Git command does): . git clone {repos-name-here.git} # what does it do? git checkout [branch] # what does it do? git fork {repos-name-here.git} # what does it do? git commit -m {&quot;commit-msg&quot;} # what does it do? git pull # what does it do? git push # what does it do? # After this line, name other commands that you can use and what they do. This should be easy, as you&#39;ve already answered the qeue . Setting Up GitHub Pages . Some of you may have come to know that GitHub Pages is starting to become outdated. So why do we still use it? The answer is that we are in a class, and following a curriculum with something like GitHub Pages is much easier than creating portfolio content from scratch, which becomes quite unecessary. Therefore, we can use GitHub Pages to create this content instead. On the topic of unecessary vs necessary coding, we don&#39;t need to make GitHub Pages from scratch as opposed to using a template that our very own Mr. Mortensen created for us. To do that, we can go to the Leuck Reunion repository and use the template to make our own GitHub Pages. Then, in Ubuntu, we can git clone our repository and open it in VSCode. After we have it open, the last thing we want to do is set up local hosting for this website, so that we can preview it and make changes in real time. To do that, head here to install Jekyll for Ubuntu, here to install Ruby next, and here to finalize the process by installing Bundler. . Setting Up FastPages . In Setting Up Github Pages, we talked about how it is easier to use a template to create portfolio content. It is also easier to use a template when creating the portfolio itself. To do that, we can use Fastpages, which is what we have been using to show our blogs, code, and projects. However, Fastpages has been deprecated for some time now, so the instructions in Week 0 won&#39;t be effective. So, we need to fork the APCSP Fastpages. To do that, follow this video to get started developing with Fastpages. . Hacks . Show how you incorporate three tools that we have installed into your project. 0.1 points for each feature. (0.3). This can include code, but definitely blog about it. | frontend hack goes here | backend hack goes here | . NOTES . Github is a very poweful tool for coders to interact and store their code, also it facilitates a way to create websites collaborate, and to open source ones code | Fastpages is a part of github pages and used within APCSP, you can create it by forking the repo adn gitclone into your terminal | Kernals are a way to input a coding system into your computer by a set of commands completed within the terminal | Vscode is a code text editor allowing people to push pull and commit. | . Incorporations . Fastpages I used this in order to fetch and have an active frontend going allowing for my unique process. | . | VSCode I used this in order to create code and push it front git, also when I am working with other collaborators I use it to pull their changes into my program. | . | Terminal/WSL I used this in order to clone my repo and add it to my file, also I was able to delete files/repos and clean up my files on vscode. Also I could use the terminal to run commands to run server such as python3 main.py and bundle exec jekyll serve | . | .

            "content": "Introduction . Frontend and backend are two essential components of a web application. The frontend is the part of the application that interacts with the user, whereas the backend is the part that handles the logic and data processing behind the scenes. . The frontend, also known as the client-side, typically consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that runs in the user&#39;s web browser. The frontend handles the user interface, page layout, and overall look of the application. It also handles user interactions, such as submitting forms, clicking buttons, and navigating between pages. . On the other hand, the backend, also known as the server-side, typically consists of a server, a database, and, in our case, APIs. The backend handles the processing and storage of data, manages user authentication and authorization, and handles business logic and rules. The backend also communicates with the frontend, providing the necessary data to render the user interface and processing user inputs. . Backend . In our class we mainly use Python and SQL/JSON to create APIs and databases. Here is a simple example of creating a SQL database and using CRUD as well. . What is CRUD . C: The &#39;C&#39; stands for create, meaning to create a new entry in a database. In this case, creating a new entry about a certain movie or TV show. . | R: Read, or to retrieve data from the database. In this case it is selecting the movie/TV shwo that you choose to display. . | U: Update, or changing an existing entry in the database. In this case it is selecting the preexisting movie/TV show and changing the values to match what you want. . | D: Delete, or removing data from the database. In this case it is selecting the preexisting movie/TV show and removing the entry from the database. . | . Films API . This API is intended to be used as a list of movies and TV shows that a person has watched. It includes attributes for the Film name(key), the year released, the language, the number of episodes, A list of the number of episodes(using pickletype), and a youtube url for the trailer. The CRUD works as follows: Create: Enter the above mentioned attributes Read: Returns all of the films and their attributes Update: Takes in new episodes watched, and a list of their names, and adds them to their respective attibutes Delete: Option for deleting every film, also takes in a name to delete that film if it exists . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;films.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE movies (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, year INTEGER, epcount INTEGER, language TEXT, trailer TEXT, eplist TEXT)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database and close the connection conn.commit() conn.close() . import sqlite3 def create(): # Ask the user for movie details title = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show title: &quot;) year = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show release year: &quot;) epcount = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show epcount: &quot;) language = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show language: &quot;) eplist = input(&quot;Enter the movie/tv show episode names: &quot;) trailer = input(&quot;Enter the link movie/tv show trailer: &quot;) # Connect to the database and create a cursor to execute SQL commands database = &#39;films.db&#39; connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record into db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO movies (title, year, epcount, language, eplist, trailer) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (title, year, epcount, language, eplist, trailer)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;{title} has been added to the list of movies.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record:&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() .

Movie deleted successfully. . Fetching . Overview . Involves retrieving data from a server or database | Can use different HTTP methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, to perform different types of operations on the server. | Fetching can be done through a variety of ways including AJAX, XHR, and Axios | In APCSP we tend to use the Fetch API over anything else | Fetching involves sending a request to a server using a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which identifies the location of the resource being requested. | Can receive data in various formats, including JSON | JSON data can be parsed into objects and arrays in JavaScript, making it easy to work with and manipulate in the frontend | . Python Fetch Using Request . import requests url = &quot;https://moviesdatabase.p.rapidapi.com/titles&quot; headers = { &quot;content-type&quot;: &quot;application/octet-stream&quot;,

            "title": "Notebook - Data Related to User Guide",
            "content": "NOTE . As you follow along, make sure to fill in the blanks and complete the coding exercises! . Introduction . When building an application that requires users to create accounts or sign in, handling data related to users is crucial. This data can include things like user profiles, preferences, and activity logs, which can be used to personalize the user experience and improve the application&#39;s performance. . For example, by storing a user&#39;s name and profile picture, the application can address the user by name and display their picture, creating a more personal experience. Activity logs can also be used to track user behavior and help the application recommend new features or improvements. . By learning how to handle data related to users effectively and responsibly, you&#39;ll be equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to build robust and user-friendly applications that meet the needs of your users. . For simplicity purposes, we will be lecturing on how one can store and manipulate user data for future utilization. . Here we go! . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . In Python, classes are templates used to create objects, which are instances of those classes. Classes define the data elements (attributes) and methods that describe the behavior of the objects. Let&#39;s explore how to define a class and create objects in Python. . Example: Defining a User class . class User: def __init__(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . In this example, we define a User class with a constructor method init that takes username and email as arguments. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . | In the context of backend functionality, this class can be used to create, manipulate, and manage user data. For example, when a new user signs up for an account, you could create a new User object with their username and email. This object can then be used to perform various operations, such as validating the user&#39;s input, storing the user&#39;s data in a database, or processing user-related requests. . | . Creating a new user: . new_user = User(&quot;john_doe&quot;, &quot;john@example.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Username: john_doe, Email: john@example.com . Lecture Topics: . Establishing Class/User Data and making a new user . In Python, classes are templates used to create objects, which are instances of those classes. Classes define the data elements (attributes) and methods that describe the behavior of the objects. Let&#39;s explore how to define a class and create objects in Python. . Example: Defining a User class . class User: def init(self, username, email): self.username = username self.email = email . def display_info(self): print(f&quot;Username: {self.username}, Email: {self.email}&quot;) . In this example, we define a User class with a constructor method init that takes username and email as arguments. The display_info method is used to print the user information. . Creating a new user: . python . new_user = User(&quot;john_doe&quot;, &quot;john@example.com&quot;) new_user.display_info() . Here, we create a new User object, new_user, with a specified username and email. We then call the display_info method to display the user&#39;s information. . Using property decorators (getter and setter) . Property Decorators allow developers to access and modify instance data more concisely. The @property decorator creates a getter method, while the @attribute.setter decorator creates a setter method. . Example: . class Employee: def __init__(self, employee_id, name): self._employee_id = employee_id self._name = name @property def name(self): return self._name @name.setter def name(self, new_name): self._name = new_name . In this example, the Employee class has a name attribute, which is accessed and modified through the name property getter and setter methods. The _name attribute uses an underscore prefix, which is a convention to indicate it should not be accessed directly. . In the context of backend functionality, this Employee class can be used to model employees within an application. You can create instances of this class to store and manage employee data, and the getter and setter methods can be used to access and modify employee information in a controller way . Usage: . employee = Employee(1001, &quot;John Doe&quot;) print(employee.name) # Get the name using the getter method employee.name = &quot;Jane Doe&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(employee.name) . John Doe Jane Doe . employee = Employee(1001, &quot;John Doe&quot;) print(employee.name) # Get the name using the getter method . employee.name = &quot;Jane Doe&quot; # Set the name using the setter method print(employee.name) . In the context of backend functionality, the getter and setter methods provide a clean and controlled way to access and modify the attributes of an object. This can be particularly useful when interacting with databases, APIs, or other parts of a web application that require the management and manipulation of object attributes. . CHECK: Explain the function of getters and setters in your own words. . Setters and getters are two differnt types of coding property decorators setters allowing you to set a value and getters allow you to obtain the key of the value | . class Car: def __init__(self, make, model, year): self._make = make self._model = model self._year = year @property def make(self): return self._make @make.setter def make(self, new_make): self._make = new_make @property def model(self): return self._model @model.setter def model(self, new_model): self._model = new_model @property def year(self): return self._year @year.setter def year(self, new_year): self._year = new_year . Take notes here on property decorators and the purpose they serve: . Property decorators are aributes that are set within coding | The setter allows you to get acess through a certain way | The getter allows you to get acsses | They are easy and help simplify the variables | . Students can then practice creating instances of their Car class and using the getter and setter methods to access and modify the car attributes. . In the context of backend functionality , this Car class can be used to model cars within an application. You can create instances of this class to store and manage car data, and the getter and setter methods can be used to access and modify car information in a controlled way. . Overview . WE COVERED: In conclusion, we have covered essential concepts in object-oriented programming using Python, including: . Defining classes and creating objects Property decorators (getter and setter) Class methods and static methods Inheritance and method overriding Working with multiple objects and class attributes . These concepts provide a solid foundation for understanding how to model real-world entities using classes and objects in Python. By learning to work with classes, objects, and their methods, students can develop more efficient and modular code. . As students become more comfortable with these concepts, they can explore more advanced topics, such as multiple inheritance, abstract classes, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Additionally, they can apply these principles to practical projects like web development with Flask and SQLite, as discussed earlier. . Overall, mastering object-oriented programming will greatly enhance students&#39; ability to develop complex and maintainable software systems. . Databases and SQlite . SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. Unlike other databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite is embedded within an application, which means it does not require a separate server process to operate. This makes SQLite a great choice for small-scale applications or for use in situations where you don&#39;t want to set up a full database server. . In this lesson, we will be demonstrating how to set up a SQLite database in Flask, which provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with SQLite databases, and we&#39;ll walk through the process of setting up a new database, creating tables, and adding data. We&#39;ll also cover some basic SQL commands that you can use to interact with your database, including CREATE TABLE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. By the end of this lesson, you&#39;ll have a good understanding of how to work with SQLite databases in Flask and be ready to start building your own applications . Setting up a SQLite database in Flask . One of the key features of flask is its ability to work seamlessly with databases, including SQLite. A database is a collection of data stored in an organized manner that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. . SQlite databse in Flask . from flask import Flask import sqlite3 # Create a Flask application app = Flask(__name__) # Connect to the SQLite database using SQLite3 conn = sqlite3.connect(&#39;example.db&#39;) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL commands cursor = conn.cursor() # Create a table in the database using SQL commands cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE example_table (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER)&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit the changes to the database conn.commit() # Close the connection conn.close() . Basic SQL commands (create, read, update, delete) . CRUD is really useful because it helps people do a bunch of things with the data stored in databases. For example, they can use it to create new tables to organize data, add new data to a table, update data that&#39;s already there, or delete data that&#39;s no longer needed. . CRUD is an acronym that stands for the fundamental operations that can be performed on a database, which are Create, Read, Update, and Delete. A widely-used lightweight database management system is SQLite, which can be easily integrated with different programming languages. . C: To create a new record in a database, you must first define the table structure that will store the data. This can be accomplished using SQL commands such as CREATE. Once the table is created, data can be added to it using the INSERT INTO command. . | R: To retrieve data from the database, you can use the READ command. You can specify which fields you want to retrieve and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. There are also several functions available to aggregate and manipulate data. . | U: To modify existing data in the database, you can use the UPDATE command. You will need to specify which table and fields you want to update, and the conditions you want to apply using the WHERE clause. . | D: To remove data from the database, you can use the DELETE command . | . Take notes here on the basic components of SQL: . SQL is a python mechanism for dbs | It uses the functionality of CRUD | You can store and create differnt types of data | Also you can add and delete to the data. | . import sqlite3 def menu(): operation = input(&quot;Enter: (C)reate (R)ead (U)pdate or (D)elete&quot;) if operation.lower() == &#39;c&#39;: create() elif operation.lower() == &#39;r&#39;: read() elif operation.lower() == &#39;u&#39;: update() elif operation.lower() == &#39;d&#39;: delete() elif len(operation)==0: # Escape Key return else: print(&quot;Please enter c, r, u, or d&quot;) menu() # recursion, repeat menu try: menu() # start menu except: print(&quot;Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu&quot;) . Perform Jupyter &#39;Run All&#39; prior to starting menu . This block of code is a menu function that helps with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) tasks and displays the schema. The menu function acts as a control point that directs the program to call different functions based on what the user wants to do. When users enter their preferred action, the input is checked to see which function to use. The menu function is created with no arguments and is called repeatedly, displaying the menu options until the user decides to leave. . Creating a Database . import sqlite3 def create_database(): # Connect to the database (will create it if it doesn&#39;t exist) connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Create the professors table if it doesn&#39;t already exist cursor.execute(&#39;&#39;&#39;CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS professors ( name TEXT, field TEXT, rating REAL, reviews TEXT )&#39;&#39;&#39;) # Commit changes and close the connection connection.commit() connection.close() # Call the function to create the database create_database() . Create Function: . import sqlite3 def create(): database = &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; name = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s name: &quot;) field = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s field of expertise: &quot;) rating = input(&quot;Enter the professor&#39;s rating (out of 10): &quot;) reviews = input(&quot;Enter any reviews or comments about the professor: &quot;) # Connect to the database and create a cursor to execute SQL commands connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Execute SQL to insert record into db cursor.execute(&quot;INSERT INTO professors (name, field, rating, reviews) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;, (name, field, rating, reviews)) # Commit the changes connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name} has been added to the list of coding professors.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while inserting record&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() create() . cool man has been added to the list of coding professors. . The create function allows users to input information about a coding professor and store it in a SQLite database named &#39;professors.db&#39;. This script prompts the user for the professor&#39;s name, field of expertise, rating out of 10, and any reviews or comments about the professor. It then establishes a connection to the SQLite database and creates a cursor object for executing SQL commands. . Read Function . import sqlite3 def read(): try: # Open a connection to the database and create a cursor connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Fetch all records from the professors table cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors&quot;) rows = cursor.fetchall() # If there are any records, print them if len(rows) &gt; 0: print(&quot;List of coding professors:&quot;) for row in rows: print(f&quot;Name: {row[0]} nField of expertise: {row[1]} nRating: {row[2]} nReviews: {row[3]} n&quot;) else: print(&quot;There are no coding professors in the list.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while connecting to the database:&quot;, error) finally: # Close the cursor and the connection to the database cursor.close() connection.close() read() . List of coding professors: Name: yueng Field of expertise: cs Rating: 10.0 Reviews: cool Name: cool man Field of expertise: af Rating: sda Reviews: das . This code demonstrates how to read data from a SQLite database using Python and the sqlite3 library. The first step is to establish a connection to the database and create a cursor object to execute SQL commands. Then, a SELECT query is executed to fetch all records from the &quot;professors&quot; table. If there are any records, the code iterates through each record and prints out the name, field of expertise, rating, and reviews for each coding professor. If there are no records in the table, a message indicating so is printed. If any error occurs during the execution of the code, an error message is printed to the console. Finally, the cursor and the connection to the database are closed to ensure that resources are freed up and prevent memory leaks. . Update Function . import sqlite3 def update(): database = &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; connection = sqlite3.connect(database) cursor = connection.cursor() try: # Get the professor&#39;s name to update name = input(&quot;Enter the name of the professor to update: &quot;) # Retrieve the current record from the database cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) record = cursor.fetchone() # If the professor is found, update the record if record: print(&quot;Enter the new information for the professor:&quot;) field = input(f&quot;Current field: {record[1]} nNew field: &quot;) rating = input(f&quot;Current rating: {record[2]} nNew rating: &quot;) reviews = input(f&quot;Current reviews: {record[3]} nNew reviews: &quot;) # Execute SQL to update the record cursor.execute(&quot;UPDATE professors SET field=?, rating=?, reviews=? WHERE name=?&quot;, (field, rating, reviews, name)) connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name}&#39;s record has been updated.&quot;) # If the professor is not found, notify the user else: print(f&quot;No record found for {name}.&quot;) except sqlite3.Error as error: print(&quot;Error while updating record&quot;, error) # Close cursor and connection cursor.close() connection.close() update () . No record found for . . This is an implementation of an update function for the professors database using the sqlite3 module in Python. The function first establishes a connection to the database file &#39;instance/professors.db&#39; and creates a cursor object to execute SQL commands. It prompts the user to enter the name of the professor to update and retrieves the corresponding record from the database using a SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to match the professor&#39;s name. If the professor is found in the database, the user is prompted to enter new information for the professor&#39;s field of expertise, rating, and reviews. The function then executes an UPDATE statement with the new information to update the record in the database. If the professor is not found, the function notifies the user that no record was found. Finally, the function closes the cursor and connection to the database. The try-except block is used to catch any potential errors that may occur during the execution of the function. . Delete Function . import sqlite3 def delete(): # Connect to the database and create a cursor connection = sqlite3.connect(&#39;instance/professors.db&#39;) cursor = connection.cursor() # Prompt the user for the name of the professor to delete name = input(&quot;Enter the name of the professor you want to delete: &quot;) # Use a SQL query to find the professor with the given name cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT * FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) row = cursor.fetchone() # If the professor exists, confirm deletion and delete the record if row: confirm = input(f&quot;Are you sure you want to delete {name}? (y/n): &quot;) if confirm.lower() == &#39;y&#39;: cursor.execute(&quot;DELETE FROM professors WHERE name=?&quot;, (name,)) connection.commit() print(f&quot;{name} has been deleted from the list of coding professors.&quot;) else: print(f&quot;{name} not found in the list of coding professors.&quot;) # Close the cursor and the connection to the database cursor.close() connection.close() delete() . not found in the list of coding professors. . This code is a Python function for deleting a record from a SQLite database. The function prompts the user to input the name of the professor they want to delete. It then uses a SQL query to search for the professor in the database. If the professor is found, the user is prompted to confirm the deletion. If the user confirms, the function executes a SQL command to delete the record from the database. The function also prints a message confirming that the professor has been deleted from the list of coding professors. If the professor is not found in the database, the function prints a message indicating that the professor is not in the list. . Our Project ... in the works . SAM Messaging System .

            "content": "Review Topics . All of the topics below are things that have been heavily covered and used throughout the class. We will mostly be focusing on more complicated uses and mechanics of these topics. . Lists . What are Lists? Lists are an ordered sequence of elements, where each element is a variable | Unlike dictionaries, lists&#39; keys are all integers that describe the order of the list | Lists can also store data and are very simple and basic algorithm to use | Lists are also have an index allowing you to acssess them | . | . Some examples of lists: . Playlist of songs | names of students in a class | contacts on your phone . | Each element of a string is referenced by an index (which is a number) and they generally start 0 but for the AP Exam it starts at 1. . AP Exam: 1,2,3,4 etc. | Python: 0,1,2,3 etc. | . | . How do lists Manage Complexity of a program? . We may not need as many variables. For example: One Variable that holds all students would be better than having a variable for EACH student | There can also be a list of test scores so if they need to be curved then the same calculation can be applied to the list (that has all the students) instead of doing the calculations one at a time | They also can be stored as a function allowing for their to be more calling wihtin a program | . | . Answer the following questions about the code block below: . Why do you think lists are helpful? What word does College Board like to use to describe the function of lists? | Lists are important because they help store data within a program also they allow to be called and updated as a function. Collegeboard uses words like abstraction for lists as seen in the rubric | . # variable of type string name = &quot;Sri Kotturi&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 16 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 90.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Bash&quot;, &quot;html&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[2]&quot;, langs[2], type(langs[2])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . name Sri Kotturi &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; age 16 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; score 90.0 &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; langs [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;, &#39;html&#39;] &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; - langs[2] Java &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; person {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;Sri Kotturi&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 16, &#39;score&#39;: 90.0, &#39;langs&#39;: [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;, &#39;html&#39;]} &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; - person[&#34;name&#34;] Sri Kotturi &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . Mathematical Expressions . What is the output of the cell below? What Mathematical Expressions do you see being used? (List them below.) . The output of the cell below is 10 the expression being used below is the | The mathematical expresion being used in addition and floor division | . grade1 = 10 grade2 = grade1 average_grade = (grade1 + grade2) // 2 #what are these two slashes? print(average_grade) . 10 . What is the value of num1, num2, and num3? Explain how each number ended up what it was. . The value of numb one is 4096 as its 4^6 since num1 = num 2^3 which is 4^6 | The output for num 3 is 1 since it is the remainder since the percent represents mod so it would be 2 mod 5 which is the remainder is 1 | Num 1 is the two numbers 4096 + 1 // 9 which is 455 | . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 ** num3 num3 = num1 % 5 num2 = (num1 + num3) // 9 print(num1) print(num2) print(num3) . 4096 455 1 . Conditionals What is a conditional?: . Statement that allows code to execute different instructions if a certain condition is true or false Allows program to make decisions based on data and input What are the main types of conditional statements?: . | if . | elif | else | If statements The if statement is used to check if a certain condition is true. The condition can be any expression that evaulates to a boolean value, True or False. If the condition is True, then it executes a code block | If (condition) then (consequence) | Example: | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number&quot;)) if x &gt; 0: # if condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) # code that will execute if condition is met . x is positive . Else . The else statemnt executes a code block when the if condition is False. | If (condition) then (consequence A), else (consequence B) | . Elif . The elif statement can check multiple conditions in a sequence, and execute a certain block of code if any of the conditions are true. | If (condition) then (consequence A), elif (condition) then (consequence B), else (consequence C) . | Example adding onto the code from before to take negative numbers and 0 into account . | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number, x:&quot;)) if x &gt; 0: # if condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is positive&quot;) # code that will execute if condition is met elif x &lt; 0: # if previous condition not true... elif condition, check if this is true of false print(&quot;x is negative&quot;)# code that will execute if condition is met else: # everything else, in this case it is if x == 0 print(&quot;x is zero&quot;) # only executes if all previous conditions are not met . x is negative . Nested Conditionals . What is a nested conditional?: . Conditional statement inside another conditional statement | Allows to check for more complex condition where one condition depends on another | . Nested Conditional Statements . Example | . x = int(input(&quot;Enter a number, x:&quot;)) if x % 2 == 0: print(&quot;x is even divisible by 2&quot;) # only ever checks is x is divisble by 3 if x is even. nested conditional if x % 3 == 0: print(&quot;x is divisible by 3&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not divisible by 3&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is odd&quot;) . x is even divisible by 2 x is not divisible by 3 . Indentation . When using conditionals and nested conditionals in Python, it is important to pay attention to the level of indentation in the code. The code inside the if, elif, and else blocks must be indented so they are nested wihtin the outer statements. This way, Python knows which code belongs to which block. . Binary Search . What is binary search and what is it used for?: . The searching element of | Find and select a specific element in a sorted list of elements | . How does binary search work?: . Repeatedly divides the search interval in half to find the middle element and compares the middle value to the target value, if not the same then it continues on to either the lower or upper half | Eliminate half of the remaining search interval elements each time | Efficient way to search for element in large dataset | . What is the time complexity and why?: . O(log(N)) | The maximum number of iterations is the amount of times the list can be divided in half until it reaches 1 number | Dividing by 2, so it is log2(N), logarigthm of n base 2 . | You may recognize the example below from the binary lesson last Friday . | . import random def binary_search_game(): low = 1 high = 100 target = random.randint(low, high) while True: guess = (low + high) // 2 print(f&quot;Is your number {guess}?&quot;) response = input(&quot;Enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;: &quot;) # conditional statements to check target number and guess if response == &#39;yes&#39;: print(f&quot;I guessed your number {guess}!&quot;) break elif response == &#39;higher&#39;: low = guess + 1 elif response == &#39;lower&#39;: high = guess - 1 else: print(&quot;Invalid input, please enter &#39;higher&#39;, &#39;lower&#39;, or &#39;yes&#39;.&quot;) binary_search_game() . Is your number 50? Is your number 25? Is your number 12? Is your number 6? Is your number 3? I guessed your number 3! . Quick Hack . Write a program using conditionals and nested conditionals . Ideas: Quiz, game (rock paper scissors, guess number), etc | . team_a_score = int(input(&quot;Enter the score of team A: &quot;)) team_b_score = int(input(&quot;Enter the score of team B: &quot;)) if team_a_score &gt; team_b_score: print(&quot;Team A wins!&quot;) elif team_a_score &lt; team_b_score: print(&quot;Team B wins!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It&#39;s a tie!&quot;) if team_a_score &gt;= 3: print(&quot;Both teams played well, but Team A wins on aggregate!&quot;) else: if team_b_score &gt;= 3: print(&quot;Both teams played well, but Team B wins on aggregate!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It&#39;s still a tie on aggregate!&quot;) . Team A wins! . Introduction to Algorithms . an algorithm is a set of instructions that describes how to solve a problem or perform a specific task using a computer program. | It is a precise sequence of computational steps that take an input and produce an output | . How do Algorithms relate to data structures? . Algorithms often rely on specific data structures to solve problems efficiently. | Sorting algorithms require a data structure such as an array or a linked list to store and manipulate data. | Searching algorithms such as binary search require data structures like arrays or trees to organize and search through data. | . Important Terms . What is an algorithm? . it is a infinite set of instructions that accomplishes a specific task | . Sequencing . means that there is an order in which to do things | . Selection . Helps to choose two different outcomes based off of a decision that the programmer wants to make | . Iteration . Repeat something until the condition is met. (also referred to as repetition) | . Calling and Developing Procedures . A procedure is a sequence of instructions that performs a specific task. | To call a procedure, you need to know its name and any arguments it requires. | When a procedure is called, the program jumps to its instruction and starts executing it. | The arguments passed to a procedure can be used within the procedure to perform tasks or calculations. | After the procedure has completed its task, it returns control back to the calling program. | . def add_numbers(a, b): sum = a + b print(&quot;The sum of&quot;, a, &quot;and&quot;, b, &quot;is&quot;, sum) # Call the procedure with arguments 5 and 7 add_numbers(5, 7) . The sum of 5 and 7 is 12 . The result of the procedure can be stored in a variable, printed to the screen, or used in any other way that is required by the program. | Procedures can be defined within the same program or in external files, and can be reused across multiple parts of the program. | To avoid errors and improve code readability, it&#39;s important to define and call procedures with proper syntax and conventions that are appropriate for the programming language you&#39;re using. | . def calculate_average(numbers): total = sum(numbers) count = len(numbers) average = total / count return average # Call the procedure with a list of numbers numbers_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] result = calculate_average(numbers_list) # Display the result print(&quot;The average of&quot;, numbers_list, &quot;is&quot;, result) . The average of [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] is 30.0 . Algorithmic Efficiency . Algorithmic efficiency refers to the amount of time and resources needed to execute an algorithm. | The efficiency of an algorithm can be measured in terms of its time complexity and space complexity. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | Space complexity refers to the amount of memory required by an algorithm to complete its task as a function of its input size. | can be analyzed using Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the worst-case time and space complexity of the algorithm. | . | . What is the time complexity of the following code: . - O(N) - O(N*log(N)) - O(N * Sqrt(N)) - O(N*N) . Answer . The time complexity is - O(N*N) because it uses two loops which meat that n is squared. | . a = 0 for i in range(N): for j in reversed(range(i, N)): a = a + i + j . What will be the time complexity of the following code? . n | (n+1) | n(n-1) | n(n+1); this beucase it is itterated twice so teh n refers twice and the value is added upon +1 | . value = 0 for i in range(n): #iterates &quot;n&quot; times, with &quot;i&quot; taking on values from 0 to n-1. for j in range(i): # iterates &quot;i&quot; times, with &quot;j&quot; taking on values from 0 to i-1. value=value+1 . Efficiency can be improved by optimizing algorithms or by using more efficient data structures and algorithms. Some common techniques for improving efficiency include reducing the size of the input data, caching results, and parallelizing tasks. | Understanding algorithmic efficiency is important in software development, as it can impact the performance of applications and their ability to scale with larger data sets. | . | . Iteration and Simulations . Simulations are models of real-world phenomena or systems that use mathematical algorithms and computer programs simulate the real behavior and aspects of the subject being modeled. . Simulations are most often used to model complex or time-consuming things that would be difficult to test in real life, such as modeling the spread of diseases in certain ecosystems or testing the functionality of a potential product before it is made. . In this lesson, we will be looking at lists, iteration, and random values through the lens of simulations. . PLEASE RUN THE CODE BELOW BEFORE INTERACTING WITH THE CODE SEGMENTS IN THIS SECTION! . class Card: def __init__(self, suit, val): self.suit = suit self.val = val if val == 11: self.kind = &quot;Ace&quot; elif val == 12: self.kind = &quot;Jack&quot; elif val == 13: self.kind = &quot;Queen&quot; elif val == 14: self.kind = &quot;King&quot; else: self.kind = str(self.val) #return a formatted string version of a card def show(self): return f&quot;{self.kind} of {self.suit}&quot; #adjust aces to prevent breaking def ace_adj(self): if self.kind == &quot;Ace&quot;: self.val = 1 . Review: Lists and Iteration . Lists and iteration work hand-in-hand to efficiently process and/or modify multiple values at once. In a card game, for example, lists and iteration are used together frequently to make the game work correctly. . For Loops . For loops are probably the most well-known type of iterative loop used in code. Most of us know about the for variable in list format. . One helpful tool not a lot of people know about is the enumerate() function. When used in conjunction with a for loop, you can always have _ and value of each selected list entry. . numlist = [3, 5, 68, 203] for key, num in enumerate(numlist): print(f&quot;This entry&#39;s index is {str(key)}, but its value is {str(num)}.&quot;) print(f&quot;The difference between the value and the index is {num - key}.&quot;) . This entry&#39;s index is 0, but its value is 3. The difference between the value and the index is 3. This entry&#39;s index is 1, but its value is 5. The difference between the value and the index is 4. This entry&#39;s index is 2, but its value is 68. The difference between the value and the index is 66. This entry&#39;s index is 3, but its value is 203. The difference between the value and the index is 200. . QUESTION: How is the key, num in enumerate(list) format similar to the format used when applying a for loop to a dictionary? . Answer: IT is similar to a loop becuase this way it is an itteration and goes through each number in the list whith its index number . List Comprehension . You may also see for loops used within a list like below. We went over this in class fairly recently. In this case, it is used to show the cards in the hand of a player. . player_hand = [] # the player&#39;s hand is represented as a list # because lists are mutable (can change), they can be added to, like drawing a card # assume the deck below is a a deck of shuffled cards deck = [Card(&quot;Hearts&quot;, 3), Card(&quot;Spades&quot;, 12), Card(&quot;Diamonds&quot;, 11)] def draw_card(hand, deck): hand.append(deck.pop()) #try it out draw_card(player_hand, deck) print([card.show() for card in player_hand]) . [&#39;Ace of Diamonds&#39;] . Recursive Loops . Recursive loops have you calling one function inside of another. If a function must make some change to a certain value multiple times, it is oftem most efficient to have a function call itself with slightly different arguments like the fibonacci sequence below. . def fibonacci(terms): if terms &lt;= 1: return terms return fibonacci(terms-1) + fibonacci(terms-2) fibonacci(5) . 5 . Nesting Loops . Nesting loops increases the time complexity of the program, but it can be used to do things like make a card deck (see below). . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): #HINT: try replacing this function deck.append(Card(suit, val)) . While Loops . While loops aren&#39;t used in the program, but they offer a different way to repeat a set of instructions in a program. The procedure below the while [condition] line will occur until the condition is made not true. . Student Interaction: How could this build function be altered to function with a while loop within it? You cana add a range between 2 and 15 and print if the card value is less than 15 and greater than 2 . def build(deck): for suit in [&quot;Spades&quot;, &quot;Clubs&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Hearts&quot;]: for val in range(2, 15): deck.append(Card(suit, val)) #HINT: you may want to make an incrementing i variable . While loops also alter an alternative way to loop a set of instructions forever, until a precise thing occurs to break the loop. See the code below. . import random i = 0 while True: i += 1 ch = random.randint(1, 11) if ch == 10: print(f&quot;It took {str(i)} random generations to get 10.&quot;) break . It took 2 random generations to get 10. . 49 random generations is a lot more than it would normally take, but it&#39;s important for code to be able to model unlikely, yet possible scenarios. Speaking of random values... . Random Values . Because unpredictable randomness occurs in the real world, it&#39;s important to have a way to represent it. Simulations are able to use randomization, which could be in the form of random number generation or other methods like shuffle. . Card decks are a great example of how random values can be used to represent real-world scenarios. In the card simulation, the random module&#39;s shuffle function is used to quite literally shuffle the deck, seen below. . def shuffle(deck): random.shuffle(deck) . Often, random selection methods use functions like _radint_____ or ____radrange____ as ways to select certain indexes in lists, or might use the random numbers in some other way. . QUESTION: Without shuffling the card order of the deck, can you think of a way that the aforementioned random module functions could be used to get a random card from the deck? Do so in the code cell below. . Yes you could find a random card through lists and loops by saying for a card within a certain ran and suit print that within a deck setting its range | . import random #find another random function that could pull a random card from a deck of UNSORTED cards import random # Define the deck of cards suits = [&#39;Hearts&#39;, &#39;Diamonds&#39;, &#39;Clubs&#39;, &#39;Spades&#39;] ranks = [&#39;Ace&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;4&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;6&#39;, &#39;7&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;10&#39;, &#39;Jack&#39;, &#39;Queen&#39;, &#39;King&#39;] deck = [(rank, suit) for rank in ranks for suit in suits] # Select a random card from the deck random_card = random.choice(deck) # Print the selected card print(&quot;The random card is:&quot;, random_card[0], &quot;of&quot;, random_card[1]) . The random card is: 7 of Clubs . Simulation Homework . Now that you&#39;ve learned about simulations and how they&#39;re used, it&#39;s time to apply that knowledge by creating a (basic) simulation of a real-world scenario. It can be something in nature, like the changes in the wildlife population of a certain area; it can be a game, like Uno (no blackjack though, that&#39;s taken); or it can be something completely random and unique. . The simulation must include... . Use of at least one random value | At least one list or similar data type (dictionary, set, etc.) | Efficient use of iteration (must support the purpose of the simualtion) | Selection (use of conditionals) | . Do this in your student copy in the cell provided. This is worth 0.9 (or more with extra credit) out of the 3 possible points. . # (Concert attendance? Wind speeds? Interactions between subjects in large environments?) # Think about the sort of things that could be saved in lists, dictionaries, etc. # (Even better if you can take advantage of the specific features of multiple types of data sets!) # What kind of iteration happens in the real world? # What occurs repeatedly, even over a long period of time? # You could model the results of a disease spreading through a population without it taking IRL years. import random # Define the number of times to roll the dice num_rolls = 100000 # Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each sum sum_freq = {i: 0 for i in range(2, 13)} # Roll the dice num_rolls times for i in range(num_rolls): # Roll two dice dice1 = random.randint(1, 6) dice2 = random.randint(1, 6) # Calculate the sum of the two dice total = dice1 + dice2 # Update the frequency count for the sum sum_freq[total] += 1 # Print the frequency of each sum print(&quot;Frequency of each sum:&quot;) for i in range(2, 13): print(f&quot;{i}: {sum_freq[i]}&quot;) import random # Define the number of times to roll the dice num_rolls = 100000 # Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each sum sum_freq = {i: 0 for i in range(2, 13)} # Roll the dice num_rolls times for i in range(num_rolls): # Roll two dice dice1 = random.randint(1, 6) dice2 = random.randint(1, 6) # Calculate the sum of the two dice total = dice1 + dice2 # Update the frequency count for the sum sum_freq[total] += 1 # Print the frequency of each sum print(&quot;Frequency of each sum:&quot;) for i in range(2, 13): print(f&quot;{i}: {sum_freq[i]}&quot;) . Frequency of each sum: 2: 2823 3: 5639 4: 8285 5: 11044 6: 13991 7: 16748 8: 13694 9: 11183 10: 8237 11: 5491 12: 2865 Frequency of each sum: 2: 2822 3: 5544 4: 8302 5: 11131 6: 14103 7: 16686 8: 13651 9: 11133 10: 8318 11: 5527 12: 2783 . Databases . We have already gone over databases in this class, but here is a refresher. A database contains data that&#39;s stored in columns and rows. The information in this database can then be pulled from the database and can be used in a program. . Setting Up the Database . Run the code cell below to prepare SQLite to create the database. If your system is struggling with the flask functions, verify that you&#39;re in the correct Python environment. REMEMBER: You should only db.init_app(app) ONCE during the process! . from flask import Flask from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy # Setup of key Flask object (app) app = Flask(__name__) # Setup SQLAlchemy object and properties for the database (db) database = &#39;sqlite:///sqlite.db&#39; # path and filename of database app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS&#39;] = False app.config[&#39;SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI&#39;] = database app.config[&#39;SECRET_KEY&#39;] = &#39;SECRET_KEY&#39; db = SQLAlchemy() # This belongs in place where it runs once per project db.init_app(app) . The Model File . The model file plays a crucial role in the formation of the database. . The model helps to create new databases | It provides a standardized method for formating the database entries across different systems | Objects used within the database are created | . import os, base64 import json from sqlalchemy.exc import IntegrityError # Define the User class to manage actions in the &#39;users&#39; table class User(db.Model): __tablename__ = &#39;players&#39; # table name is plural, class name is singular # Define the User schema with &quot;vars&quot; from object id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True) _username = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=False, nullable=False) _streak = db.Column(db.Integer, unique=True, nullable=False) # constructor of a User object, initializes the instance variables within object (self) def __init__(self, username, streak): self._username = username self._streak = streak # a username getter method, extracts username from object @property def username(self): return self._username # a setter function, allows username to be updated after initial object creation @username.setter def username(self, username): self._username = username # a getter method, extracts streak from object @property def streak(self): return self._streak # a setter function, allows streak to be updated after initial object creation @streak.setter def streak(self, streak): self._streak = streak # output content using str(object) in human readable form, uses getter # output content using json dumps, this is ready for API response def __str__(self): return json.dumps(self.read()) # CRUD create/add a new record to the table # returns self or None on error def create(self): try: # creates a person object from User(db.Model) class, passes initializers db.session.add(self) # add prepares to persist person object to Users table db.session.commit() # SqlAlchemy &quot;unit of work pattern&quot; requires a manual commit return self except IntegrityError: db.session.remove() return None # CRUD read converts self to dictionary # returns dictionary def read(self): return { &quot;id&quot;: self.id, &quot;username&quot;: self.username, &quot;streak&quot;: self.streak } # CRUD update: updates user name, password, phone # returns self def update(self, username, streak): &quot;&quot;&quot;only updates values with length&quot;&quot;&quot; if len(username) &gt; 0: self.username = username if streak &gt; 0: self.streak = streak db.session.commit() return self # CRUD delete: remove self # None def delete(self): db.session.delete(self) db.session.commit() return None &quot;&quot;&quot;Database Creation and Testing &quot;&quot;&quot; # Builds working data for testing def initUsers(): with app.app_context(): &quot;&quot;&quot;Create database and tables&quot;&quot;&quot; db.create_all() &quot;&quot;&quot;Tester data for table&quot;&quot;&quot; u1 = User(username=&quot;Mr. Cards&quot;, streak=5) u2 = User(username=&quot;Kard Kowntre&quot;, streak=10) u3 = User(username=&quot;Un Bea Table&quot;, streak=15) users = [u1, u2, u3] &quot;&quot;&quot;Builds sample user/note(s) data&quot;&quot;&quot; for user in users: try: user.create() print(f&#39;Created user with username &quot;{user.username}&quot;.&#39;) except IntegrityError: &#39;&#39;&#39;fails with bad or duplicate data&#39;&#39;&#39; db.session.remove() print(f&quot;Records exist, duplicate email, or error: {user.username}&quot;) . The init Fuction . The init method has one purpose which is to initialize the object&#39;s attributes. This is what is known as the constructor. In our project, the init method initalizes the username and streak as variables. . def __init__(self, username, streak): self._username = username self._score = streak . Setters and Getters . Setters and Getters are important methods used when writing code for databases. . Setter: Setter: a method that allows us to set or change the value of an attribute in a class. . | Getter: Getter: a method that allows us to access an attribute in a given class. . | . Setter Example . @streak.setter def streak(self, streak): self._streak = streak . Getter Example . @property def streak(self): return self._streak . The Api File . An API is an important part of having a functional database. . it acts as a messenger that allows programs to access data from the others | it connects all information | for a database, an api retrieves the data requested in code for the user | . import json from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building user_api = Blueprint(&#39;user_api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/users&#39;) api = Api(user_api) class UserAPI: class _CRUD(Resource): # User API operation for Create, Read. THe Update, Delete methods need to be implemeented def post(self): # Create method &#39;&#39;&#39; Read data for json body &#39;&#39;&#39; body = request.get_json() &#39;&#39;&#39; Avoid garbage in, error checking &#39;&#39;&#39; # validate name username = body.get(&#39;username&#39;) if username is None or len(username) &lt; 1: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Username is missing, or is less than a character&#39;}, 400 # validate uid streak = body.get(&#39;streak&#39;) if streak is None or streak &lt; 1: return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Streak is missing, or is less than 1&#39;}, 400 &#39;&#39;&#39; #1: Key code block, setup USER OBJECT &#39;&#39;&#39; uo = User(username=username, streak=streak) &#39;&#39;&#39; #2: Key Code block to add user to database &#39;&#39;&#39; # create user in database user = uo.create() # success returns json of user if user: return jsonify(user.read()) # failure returns error return {&#39;message&#39;: f&#39;Processed {username}, either a format error or a duplicate&#39;}, 400 def get(self): # Read Method users = User.query.all() # read/extract all users from database json_ready = [user.read() for user in users] # prepare output in json return jsonify(json_ready) # jsonify creates Flask response object, more specific to APIs than json.dumps def put(self): body = request.get_json() # get the body of the request id = body.get(&#39;id&#39;) username = body.get(&#39;username&#39;) streak = body.get(&#39;streak&#39;) # get the UID (Know what to reference) user = User.query.get(id) # get the player (using the uid in this case) user.update(username=username, streak=streak) return f&quot;{user.read()} Updated&quot; def delete(self): body = request.get_json() id = body.get(&#39;id&#39;) player = User.query.get(id) player.delete() return f&quot;{player.read()} Has been deleted&quot; # building RESTapi endpoint api.add_resource(_CRUD, &#39;/&#39;) . This is important particularly in a full flask respository context, but in this case, you&#39;ll just need to run the initUsers() function. . initUsers() . Created user with username &#34;Mr. Cards&#34;. Created user with username &#34;Kard Kowntre&#34;. Created user with username &#34;Un Bea Table&#34;. . An Alternative Method of Making SQLite Databases . In a previous lesson, we went over using the cursor object in SQLite3. Rather than go over all of that here, this lesson goes over it thoroughly. (You may use this method for the homework below.) . Database Homework . For this assignment, we&#39;d like you to make your own database file as instructed above. Remember, the API file isn&#39;t necessary in this case; you&#39;ll be focusing on making the model and the init function. . Your database must include these things: . A class with at least four attributes (if not the cursor method) | Setters and getters for this class (if not the cursor method) | Each of the CRUD functions | An init function with at least four entries | A screenshot showing proof that your SQLite file has been created correctly | . Feel free to base your database on the model provided above! Ask our group if you have any questions or concerns. . import sqlite3 database = &#39;instance/product.db&#39; # this is location of database def schema(): # Connect to the database file conn = sqlite3.connect(database) # Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries cursor = conn.cursor() # Fetch results of Schema results = cursor.execute(&quot;PRAGMA table_info(&#39;product&#39;)&quot;).fetchall() # Print the results for row in results: print(row) # Close the database connection conn.close() schema() .

            "title": "SASS",
            "content": "Why SASS? . SASS is an improvement on CSS in that there are methods of abstraction. It is a stylesheet language that is compiled into CSS, which means that Sass will translate the Sass code you wrote into CSS, which is what your web browser can read . SASS vs SCSS . As you learn about Sass, you might notice something called Scss. They are basically the same thing except that Scss uses curly braces and semicolons to distinguish between lines. Sass uses indentation and newlines instead. . We will be teaching the Scss syntax because it is more commonly used. . Getting started . A easy way to write SASS and have it preprocessed into CSS is by using a Jekyll powered website, such as GitHub pages or Fastpages. . The first step is to clone a GitHub pages repo, such as this one. . Within the repository, head over to assets/css/, and open style.scss. . This is where you can create your SASS code. . To see your CSS-translated SASS code, head over to _site/assets/css/style.css . Note: You will need to run bundle exec jekyll serve before the _site directory appears. . The first few hundred lines are used to style Github&#39;s theme. Make sure to scroll to the very bottom to see the SASS code that you wrote, which is in the form of CSS. . Nesting . SASS provides a feature called nesting in which you can write styling code in a way that looks like an HTML hierarchy. | It allows you to write with many diffrent sectors | . Mini-hack . Write out the SASS equivalent for the following CSS code: . .a .b { color: green; } .a .c { color: blue; } . Sass equivalent . .a { . .b { | color: green; | } . | .c { . | color: blue; | } | . | } | . Extend/Inheritance . What are some similarities that the buttons share? What are the differences? . They have the same shape and size but the color is diffrent and the text on the boxes are diffrent | The backgounds differ | THey use the same properties | . Mixin . Mixin allows to take in parameters and give it back | IT is like a procedure but with saas and it is a type of property which give it better usage within industry | you can do a lot wiht mixin | . Mini-hack . Write out a mixin in SASS that takes in a color and a font size as the parameter. Within the mixin, set the background color and font color to the color parameter, and set the font size to the font size parameter. Then create a selector that calls the mixin, and pass in a color and font size of your choice as the arguments. . @mixin custom-style($color, $font-size) { background-color: $color; color: $color; font-size: $font-size; } .custom-selector { @include custom-style(#91ff00, 18px); } . Function . Function are avalble within saas | They can call with paranthesis and are like parameters in python | . Import . Imports are to prevent clutter through files | You can make many files like style.css and store them in one places | . Quiz Answers . B A C B D B B . // Using Mixin To create buttons that are blue and gray @mixin button($color, $bg-color, $border-radius) { display: inline-block; padding: 10px 20px; background-color: $bg-color; color: $color; border-radius: $border-radius; text-decoration: none; } .button-primary { @include button(#fff, #007bff, 5px); } .button-secondary { @include button(#fff, #6c757d, 5px); } . More Features EXTRA CREDIT . Within saas there is another features such as control directives; this allows for usage of if else and for which are conditionals likewise used in python | Color functions are another saas feature which alow oyu to lighten() darken() and saturate() backgrounds and buttons within SAAS these are more properties that are usen through saas | . SASS Hacks . Take notes and complete the mini-hacks. (0.9) . | Complete the quiz questions and provide your answers in this notebook. (0.9) . | Use SASS to create something that uses either extend or mixin. (0.9) . | Extra credit: Research other SASS features and blog about what you learned or add to your SASS project with any extra features not covered in this lesson.

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. . The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP). This layer handles tasks such as packet addressing and routing, fragmentation and reassembly, and network congestion control. . Fault Tolerance . Watch both Daily videos for 4.2 .

            "title": "Data Structures- Hashmaps, Sets, Hash Tables, Hashing and Collisions",
            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictonary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1). | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # I notice that the output is 123 showing that a set is a list that doesen&#39;t repeat again. # # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # They are in the same techtalk as hasmaps due to the fact that hashmaps are out of dictionaries which are a bit differet from # . {1, 2, 3} .

This is becuase it pumps me up and my energy and gives me a boost when doing homework and when I am preparing for a soccer game. In addition the tone of the song reminds me of summer as it has a happy bass in the back and uses a lot of radio tone which is always pleasent within music. In addition to this has been recently added to my liked songs as I was listening to this song on loop while completing these hacks. To be really honest I didint know much about taylor swift prior to this however my sister is a certified swiftie and has educated me about this amazing artist in addition I will continue to listen to her songs. Some of my honorable mentions are ANTI HERO, BAD BLOOD, and LOVE STORY. | .",

The asnwer is 50 this is becuase in order to find the minium it is the smallest number possible with a combination of numbers.

Overall, I beleives I was able to preform decently on this mc test, due to the fact I was able to answer mode questions without the need of googling it. In order to get ready for teh AP test there are still some topics I need extra revision on. Firstly I need to understand how to implement a procedure within code, this is beucase many time I read the proceudre wrong or I just simply dont understand this. This can be improved on by watching the video and taking notes in order to improve. In addition I feel when taking these mcq test I need better habits as sometimes I rush to answers and dont understand the problem fully. This can be fixed by oging through each option and fully understand the program. | . Errors and Explanations. . .

I got this wrong becuase I red it wrong and I didnt see that I was looking to display and I ddint see the block without a or b. | . . The reason this is wrong is bedcuase it creates to open the motor when the gate is already open, I didnt understand this becuase when i chose this option I beleived that the conteted didnt have limitations like only open wihtin this? | . . I misread the question and I thought it was asking me how many times this was being executed, not what needed to be repeated which would lead to 2 becyase the robot only needs to be rotating this much in order to get to that endpoint. | . . This is wrong becuase the data can be stored in any numerical based as long as their sorted making this to be answer 2 becuase it has to be sorted based on values such as size. | . .

In addition to that I really liked teh project we made as it allowed me to mix creativity with STEM we created a vibrating tooth brush with a help of a tooth brush a +/- cord and a battery that gave it energy. In addition I learned a lot from Ashley and John and would love to talk to them soon! | . . Introduction . Speaker 1: John is a computer scientist at csusm he really enjoys programming and finds its a great interest within coding, he wanted to pursue computer science becuase he finds a great intrest with computers and he thought that he would want to look toward a better understanding. . Speaker 2: Ashley went to csusm and is majored in applied physics, although she has failed many times in highschool and in college within calc and physics but she says this doesen’t define her as a person and she tries to frequently, she often encounters compter scinece in her times when solving her problems. . Cal State SM Pathways . Wuthin csusm there are many options for getting a degree, you gan do with mathematics biochemistry, elecctrical engineering, and software engineering, bs biotechnology, and biological sciences. They also have specialty in physics, chemistry, biotech, math, computer science, software engineering. | Also there is robotics cybersecuriyy clubs, 3d printing, women in stem, society of women engineering, society of physics engineering etc | In addition you should have more ways to get involved and get into internships with to get more experience and have more conenectivity with other people, | In adddition there are many summer programs called summer scholars program and it is a paid prgram allowing you to get paid up to 6000$ you can learn mmore about computer science and get a better undertanding of what you want to do | When paying for college you are able to take loans whcih are subsidized loas nad unsubsidized loan and subsidizes one help you with an unsubsidized loan, you have to pay back more money because of the interest that keeps adding up, while with a subsidized loan, someone else helps you out by paying some or all of the interest for you. | you can get a job within a public or a private institution and allow you to accel in life, in addition there are graduate programs with allows you to continue your education while getting a payment | .",

            "content": "a = 0 b = 0 for i in range(N): a = a + random() for i in range(M): b= b + random() . Answer and Explanation . The answer to this is O(N + M) time, O(1) space; this is because the times are being added and the value is only to find 1 leaving this as a correct answer declaring the vairable and getting to answer i. . a = 0; for i in range(N): for j in reversed(range(i,N)): a = a + i + j; . Answer/ Explanation . The answer for this is O(N*N) this is beu case since n is i and n,i is the range it makes 0+ n +N-1 giving a root leading to this answer . k = 0; for i in range(n//2,n): for j in range(2,n,pow(2,j)): k = k + n / 2; . Answer/ Explanation . The answer is O(nLogn) this is buecase it refers to the breaking down the code and somethign to the power of something = log meaning this would be the most logical answer itterated through the loop. . What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y? . Answer/ Explanation . X will always be a better choice for large inputs This is the answer becuase asymptomatically means when apporcahing a large or small function wihtin math leaving it to work . a = 0 i = N while (i &gt; 0): a += i i //= 2 . Explanation . The answer is O(log N) beucaese you get a log value thorught this fucntion as its something to the power of something = something . Which of the following best describes the useful criterion for comparing the efficiency of algorithms? . Explanation . Both time and memory are needed as that is what gets you to a good algorithm meaning its is the basis of time/space | . How is time complexity measured? . Explanation . By counting the number of primitive operations performed by the algorithm on a given input size. This complexity has to do with algorithms and meaning within an input the algorithm is measured and so are operations within in . for i in range(n): i=i*k . Explanation . xO(logkn) this is beucase of the loop of i and n giving the out put this | . value = 0; for i in range(n): for j in range(i): value=value+1 . Explanation . The answer is n(n-1), meaning that n is n-1 however I am not sure as the loop is a bit confusing and adds so I dont understand the subtraction | . The Big-O notation provides an asymptotic comparison in the running time of algorithms. For n &lt; n0​​, algorithm A might run faster than algorithm B, for instance. . Explanation .

For my project is could be better with croud sourcing as we could use data to make charts and add reviews for diffent houses throughout our site | . | What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. For our project we could take data about the different houses on our websites which can give us more data to help improve layouts and allow for better user experience. In addition we can add a chatting forum where we talk about houses on our site and the persons experience. | . | 5.5 Reflection . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. When you make a github repo it asks for specofic types of licenses that have relation to your code and how acsessible you want it. Some of the licenses are a community license such as an apache which allows for your repository to be acsessible to the public. In additon there is an mit license which also allows for acsessible use of your projects features. | . | In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. In the coding world today programmers use code for many differnt situations and they also encouter different issues. When this happens many people use slackoverflow, and the github community for help where they can recieve help. However sometimes people also copy code which bring the idea of of licensing which can be used for people who allow other to use their code, people who have some open source code, and others who demand for credit and limit their open source code on their projects. | . | Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. | For our team we have decided to make an MIT license for both our front end and backend sites, we decided this would be the best Idea as we dont mind open sourcing our code as we are students so other peers could see our code giving us feedback or allowing us to help them as well. In addition I based this principle for my sites also implementing an MIT license | Licence for my PAGE | Licence for Team PAGE | . 5.6 Reflection . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. Project I have seen on APCSP is when people use logins in order to create accounts for a database. | . | What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? In some sense knowing more about pll can make it seem a bit scary however if you think from a consumer standpoint the developers are just trying to make your interaction feel more personal in order to keep you on their site for longer. | . | Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. A good password that uses letters numbers and special symbols in addition it should be at least 9 characters long ensuring your online safety. | . | Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. symetric encryption is the use of one key to get public data and asymetric is the use of getting 2 keys one public and the other as private. | . | Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. An example is when you make an instance and use a certain key. | . | Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. A phising scheme I have learned is peopel on social media send you a link with fake information and you log in which leaves your account hacked, also there are text messages phone calls. | . |",

Sequential search is not as good as its time consuming and leaves you without use. | Small changes/mistakes can have a big impact on the result | There is often more than one way to achieve the same result | Algorithms can be created from an idea, by combining existing algorithms, or by modifying existing algorithms. | . Vocab . Iteration: Repeating steps, or instructions over and over again. ( this could be also often called a loop ) | Selection: is a decision or question. At some point in an algorithm there may need to be a question because the algorithm has reached a step where one or more options are available. | Algorithm: A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer. | Condtiional: a statement that goes if or else supporting two outcomes | procedure; a segment of code that provides an output or serves a purpose | . 1 Write this Boolean statement in the form of a conditional (if/else) statement: stayInside&#10229;((isCold) OR (isRaining)) . { if(isRaining){ day --&gt; &quot;cold&quot; } if(isCold){ day --&gt; &quot;cold&quot; } } . #During a turn, each player gets 4 attempts/chances to get the greatest number possible. #During each attempt, the player will use a random number generator to select a random number from 1 to 10. import random attempts = [] i = 1 while i &lt;= 4: attempts.append(random.randint(1,10)) i = i + 1 print(attempts) print(&quot;Maximum:&quot;, max(attempts)) # This works due to the fact if i=1 and you have 4 atemps you role between the number 1-10 leaving you to add to i per role .

To do this you put the list in alphabetical order which makes it [Market ralphs store target walmart] | This is correct due to setting everything up in the alphabet leaving it to be in this order | . 7. Explain why Binary Search is more efficient than Sequential Search . Binary search is better than sequencial search as it is a more efficient way to find items within a list rather than setting up everything side by side. . 8. [64,36,16,11,9] Explain which number you are finding, how many check it would take, and make a binary search tree . I am finding 36 first I find the middle which is (1+5/2) this would give me the middle and then I would do 1+3/2 which would get me to the number 36 that means. This makes sense becuase binary search is the way of finding the middle of each list and dividing that to make sure you can find a specific number in the list. However if you were to use sequencial search than it would mean you would have to align everything together to find 36 which would take longer and be more inconvienet. | .

            "content": "What will you learn? . You will learn how to determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment. . Essential Knowledge . The assignment operater allows a program to change the value represented to a variable. | The exam reference sheet uses the &quot;⟵&quot; to use for assignment. For example, Text: a ⟵ expression Then the code would display a block text of &quot;a ⟵ expression&quot;. The code will evaluate expression and then assigns a copy of the result to the variable a. | The value stored in a variable will be the most recent value assigned. For example, . a ⟵ 1 | a ⟵ b | a ⟵ 2 . display(b) . | . | . The code will display 1. . Storing Values . When storing values, you assign them to a variable. . Examples: . highScore ⟵ 100 | The highScore is my assignment operator and it is storing the value of 100 inside itself as a variable. This will set my highScore to 100. | . firstName ⟵ &quot;Ashley&quot; | The firstName is the variable and the text we are storing inside is &quot;Ashley.&quot; We know that the name is in text because of the quotation marks around the assignment. | . isRaining ⟵ true | The isRaining variable has the intention to be a Boolean variable which checks true or false, but it&#39;s been assigned to store the value true. | . phoneNumber ⟵ &quot;555-0101&quot; | The phoneNumber variable and the number we are storing is &quot;555-0101&quot; The number is written within text because we are not planning to do math with this number. | . Additional Vocabulary . Elements: individual value in a list that is assigned a unique index. And elements are referenced by an index. . Index: referencing elements in a list or string using natural numbers . Interaction . What will we do? . We will discuss to see how changing the order of the display can mess with the outcome. This interaction will be done at the end of the lesson when one of our groups team members will call up your table. . Practice Questions . Consider the following code segment: . num1 ⟵ 6 | num2 ⟵ 4 | num3 ⟵ 10 | . IF num1 &lt; num2 . num1 ⟵ num2 | . ELSE . num3 ⟵ num2 | . IF num2 ≥ num3 . num1 ⟵ num2 + num3 | . sum ⟵ num1 + num2 + num3 . What is the value of sum after the code segment is executed? . 18 | 14 | 16 | 12 | Click for the answer! 3. because the first three statements assign values to the variables. Since num1 &lt; num2 evaluates to false, the body of the ELSE block is executed and num3 is assigned the value 4. Since num2 ≥ num3 evaluates to true, the body of the second IF block is executed and num1 is assigned the value 8. Lastly, sum is assigned the value of 8 + 4 + 4, or 16. . Consider the following code segment . num1 ⟵ 5 | num2 ⟵ 10 | num3 ⟵ 20 | num3 ⟵ num1 | num3 ⟵ num2 | num1 ⟵ num3 | . sum ⟵ num1 + num2 + num3 . insert question . 35 | 30 | 45 | 25 | Click for the answer! 3. because the value of num1 is 20 after you go through the code segment. The value of num2 is 20 as well because it is replaced by num3&#39;s value. And the value of num3 is 5 because it is replaced by num1&#39;s value. Then you add 20 + 20 + 15 and that&#39;s how you get 45. Hacks for the lesson . Answer the practice problems and blog about which one&#39;s you got wrong. After, create at least 6 problems that are alike to what you learned in this portion of the lesson. . . Consider the following code segment: . currentScore ⟵ 10 | highScore ⟵ currentscore | currentScore ⟵ 7 | . DISPLAY (currentScore) . What will the currentScore be after running this code segment? . 17 | 10 3. 7 | none of the above | Click for the answer! 3. because that is the latest value that was stored within the variable. What will the highScore be? . 17 2. 10 | 7 | none of the above | Click for the answer! 2. because the value stored in a variable will alwasy be the most recent value assigned. . Consider the following code segment: . num1 ⟵ 4 | num2 ⟵ 6 | num1 ⟵ num 2 | . DISPLAY(num1) . DISPLAY(num2) . What is displayed after running this code segment? . 4 6 | 6 4 | 4 4 4. 6 6 | Click for the answer! 4. because the value for num 2 becomes the value of num 1 therefore making the first outcome 6 and the second outcome would be six as well because that is the value that num2 is assigned. . Consider the following code segment: . num1 ⟵ 25 | num2 ⟵ 15 | num3 ⟵ 30 | num2 ⟵ num3 | num3 ⟵ num1 | num1 ⟵ num2 | . DISPLAY(num1) . DISPLAY(num2) . DISPLAY(num3) . What is displayed after running this code segment? . 25 15 30 &lt;/mark&gt;2. 30 30 25&lt;/mark&gt; | 30 15 30 | 15 30 25 | Click for the answer! 2. because for num 1 the value is replaced by num 3&#39;s value which is 30. For num 2 the value is 30 because its replaced by num 1&#39;s value which was originally 25 but then was replaced by num 3&#39;s value 30. For num 3, the value is 25 because it&#39;s value is replaced by num 2 which num 2&#39;s value was replaced by num 1&#39;s. . Consider the following code segment: . p ⟵ 10 | q ⟵ 20 | r ⟵ 30 | s ⟵ 40 | p ⟵ q | q ⟵ r | s ⟵ q | r ⟵ p | . What is the value of r as a result of running this code segment . 10 &lt;/mark&gt;2. 20&lt;/mark&gt; | 30 | 40 | Click for the answer! 2. because q is the variable assigned to p and q&#39;s value is 20. . Consider the following code segment: . first ⟵ true | second ⟵ false | second ⟵ first | first ⟵ second | . Insert Question . The value of first is true, and the value of second is false. | The value of first is false, and the value of second is true. &lt;/mark&gt;3. The value of first is true, and the value of second is true. &lt;/mark&gt; | The value of first is false, and the value of second is false. | Click for the answer! 3. because the first two statements assign values to the variables. The third statement assigns the value of first (which is true) to second. The fourth statement assigns the value of second (which is true) to first. . Consider the following code segment: . a ⟵ 10 | b ⟵ 20 | c ⟵ 30 | d ⟵ 40 | x ⟵ 20 | b ⟵ x + b | a ⟵ x + 1 | d ⟵ c / d + 2 | . DISPLAY(a) . DISPLAY(b) . DISPLAY(c) . DISPLAY(d) . What is displayed as a result of executing the code segment? . 1. 21 40 30 50 . 10 20 30 40 | 21 40 30 40 | 21 30 40 50 | Click for the answer! 1. because the first five statements assign values to the variables. The sixth statement assigns the value of x + b (which is 40) to b. The seventh statement assigns the value of x + 1 (which is 21) to a. The eighth statement assigns the value of c + d / 2 to d. According to the order of operations, division has higher precedence than addition. Since c is 30 and d / 2 is 20, d is assigned the value 50. The last four statements display the values of a, b, c, and d.",

After going to colledge and getting a job it is important to keep your balance in life, it is important to go outside and spend time with others even though you can be left at your computer for hours. Overall engineering is a fun thing to do it makes you solve problems, collaborate, and it requires an initiative, but it is also ijmportant to remeber to keep yourself smiling all through it. | . Suman . An engineer at qualcom | works on the cell phone connectivity to networks | beleives enginnering helps people solve problems and makes them better | thinks solving problems and having communcation is a key piece of engineering | worked many jobs to gain experiences | dont be afraid to when you first enter engineering you shouldn’t be afraid | its all a team effort don’t do it alone | its important to take breaks | . Nisha . Fell in love wiht engineering at first sight | left medicince to become a software eengineer | although she like eengineering she didnt now what she wanted to do | ended up as a software eengineer | she always has a strong emphasis on hard work how it would become a useful in the future | . Questions . How to know what side of engineering you want to pursue? (software, hardware, etc)? You should always try to experience everything to be able to get your feet wet and find your passions. Once you are able to identify that you should try to build things and get involved with projects. . | What universities specialize in software engineering? In those universities, what are the majors that would help me learn the necessary skills and concepts to get a software developer job in tech app companies (Google, Amazon, Apple, Qualcomm)? What should I do in high school to increase my chances to get admitted into them? You should be challange yourself and make an impact throughought enginnering. . | .",

This will be important as it will show how we can use our coding knowledge to complete tasks in order to have a sucsessful app. . Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of this program is to be able to teach people about fitness and overall show how we can educate people on fitness with the people of the app. . Data Abstraction . The purpose of this is to have two seperate code segments which are not connected. One should show data being stored as a list and one should show data being used in the program function. . Managing Complexity . We will manage complexity by simplifyinh our code with the algorithims we use, the usage of dicts,lists,and conditionanals, and keys will be helpful. . Procedural Abstraction( . One parameter that affects the functionality of our procedure is our implementation of variables and inputs. These parameters allow us to take in information and use it to educate people on fitness. . Algorithm Implementation . We will use algorithms to calculate many statistics given inputs that the user provides. We will also use algorithms to create graphs and other ways to utilize the information calculated and provided for the users. . Testing . The way we will make people test it is by making them use the several inputs and test our calculator, and even enter the fitness course to see who will be able to get a correct result. .",

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language.

Challenge . This code segment is at a very early stage of implementation. . What are some ways to (user) error proof this code? | The code should be able to calculate the cost of the meal of the user | . Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = input (&quot;print welcome to krishivs diner make sure you read all of the items and spell them correctly! If you dont you wont be able to order! DISCLAMER: YOU MAY ONLY ORDER UP To 3 ITEMS AS WE HAVE A STAFF SHORTAGE &quot;) menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) points= 0 answer = input(&quot;what do you want to eat?&quot;) if answer == &quot;burger&quot;: print (&quot;okay that will be 3.99&quot;) points+= 3.99 elif answer == &quot;fries&quot;: print(&quot;okay that will be 1.99&quot;) points +=1.99 elif answer == &quot;drink&quot;: print(&quot;okay that will be 0.99&quot;) points +=0.99 else: print (&quot;Sorry that isn&#39;t on the menu either check your spelling or hit esc to finish order&quot;) points -= 0 answer = input(&quot;anything Else&quot;) if answer == &quot;burger&quot;: print (&quot;okay that will be 3.99&quot;) points+= 3.99 elif answer == &quot;fries&quot;: print(&quot;okay that will be 1.99&quot;) points +=1.99 elif answer == &quot;drink&quot;: print(&quot;okay that will be 0.99&quot;) points +=0.99 else: print (&quot;sorry we dont have it on the menu&quot;) points -= 0 answer = input (&quot;What Else Would You Like&quot;) if answer == &quot;burger&quot;: print (&quot;okay that will be 3.99&quot;) points+= 3.99 elif answer == &quot;fries&quot;: print(&quot;okay that will be 1.99&quot;) points +=1.99 elif answer == &quot;drink&quot;: print(&quot;okay that will be 0.99&quot;) points +=0.99 else: print (&quot;sorry we dont have that on our menu&quot;) points -= 0 print(&quot;have a nice day and thank you for eating at Krishiv&#39;s Diner&quot;) print(&quot;YOUR TOTAL IS:&quot;) print(points) .

Hacks . Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... . What errors may arise in your project? | What are some test cases that can be used? | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project? As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding. FYI, related tests could be in same Issue by using markdown checkboxes to separate tests. | . | .",

In addition to that I have learned in compsci everyone has there own path but it important to be focusing on yourself and not to worry about others. Furthermore,it is important to have your own projects because if you want to continue your career you will be able to prove that you can understand parts of coding. Also compsci is in most aspects of life so if you can understand a language it will make it easier for you in the world. If you chose to continue in this field it is important to create a resume and connect with others in the field and continue to improve your understanding of code. .
